Q1. Formulate your problem as a shortest path problem 
node i = beginning of hour i
edge (i,j) = hire a worker from hour i and them finishing their shift at hour j

Q2. Solve your shortest path formulation: give the shortest path length and a shortest path
(in the lab4.py file. If the graph is unreadable, run again. The node position are randomized, sometimes the edge will overlap)

Shortest Path: path: [7,11,2]
Shortest Path Length: 90

Q3. Interpret the shortest path length and shortest path in the context of the problem.
The nodes in the shortest path indicate when to start hiring the driver (and when the driver shift ends). 
In this case, we should hire a driver from 7-11 and from 11-2 with the cost of $50 and $40.
